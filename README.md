# opencv3

## Description of This Repository

This repo contains information about the basic functions and skills of opencv(version 4.2). 

There are two main references used throughout the whole project.

1. The official Opencv user guide 
2. Learning Opencv3 , by A.k. & G.B.

The main purpose of the repository is to record where I was during my own learning path. Thus, the language I use is Chinese or English (sometimes, a combination of both), which largely depends on the language that my reference uses.

And since the main purpose is to organize my own notes and make it convenient for future reviews, there might be some grammar/typing mistakes or lack of basic information, which I prefer not to spend my time in solving.



## Fundamentals - GUI basis and core operations









## Next step - Image processing

'Notes' contains my own notes while learning opencv. Most of the contents are from the official document of OpenCV.

- Folder 'Project1_Credit_Card_Recognition' contains the [code(.py)](https://github.com/Lloyd-S/opencv3/blob/master/Peoject1_Credit_Card_Recogniton/card_recog_final.py),images,results and the [analysis](https://github.com/Lloyd-S/opencv3/blob/master/Peoject1_Credit_Card_Recogniton/readme.md) of the OCR project--credit card recognision.
